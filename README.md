# georgBot
A discord bot made for the Astral Army channel.
# Description
The "Georg" bot uses a simple resource system.
In few words, every user can create items, which are a `name-link` pair.

For example, using command `create itemName url`, user can create an `itemName-url` pair which they can later ask georg with command `get itemName`.
### Example
 **user**: georg create google https://www.google.com


**georg**: @user, success! created google!


###### Item 'google' is now created and stored inside georg's database. Now user can fetch it.

**user**: georg get google

**georg**: @user, https://www.google.com

# Available commands

***
## get
